# Hardware-accelerator-for-mobilenets
Design of Hardware Accelerator for MobileNets and simulation using Vivado HLx Suite. The project involved implementing a CNN using PyTorch and designing the hardware accelerator using CLP-Nano architecture for MobileNets. The project was designed using System Verilog and simulated and tested using System Verilog testbench and C.

The repository contains:
1. Hardware_code folder containing all system verilog files for design and C code for Board
   It contains testbench and sample data for simulation purpose.
   C_code contains C files and .H files for testing purpose
2. MobileNets_Pytorch
   Pytorch implementation of Mobilenets
3. Output_generation_code contains code from which we are generating out input and weights
   Generate_output_from_input folder contains code to generate data for available input data
   Generate_random_output contains code from which generate random data for first layer
4. Final_report: Project Report
5. MobileNets_presentation.ppt: Project Presentation
